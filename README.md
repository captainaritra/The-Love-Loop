# The-Love-Loop
No Escape, Only Love! 💞
A fun and interactive Valentine’s Day project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project features a cute GIF in the center, asking the ultimate question:

👉 "Will you be my Valentine?" ❤️

But here’s the twist!

Clicking "No" changes the question and GIF while making the "Yes" button bigger. 😆
After a few "No" clicks, the "No" button starts moving away when you try to click it! 🤭
Eventually, the "Yes" button grows so large that you can’t help but say YES! 😍
A romantic song plays in the background with an on/off toggle for control. 🎶
🚀 Features

📌 How to Use
1️⃣ Clone the repository
