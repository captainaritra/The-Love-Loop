💖 The Love Loop

No Escape, Only Love! 💞

A fun and interactive Valentine’s Day project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project presents a cute and playful way to ask:

👉 "Will you be my Valentine?" ❤️

But here’s the twist!

Clicking "No" changes the question and GIF while making the "Yes" button bigger. 😆

After a few "No" clicks, the "No" button starts running away from your cursor! 🤭

Eventually, the "Yes" button grows so large that you can’t help but say YES! 😍

A romantic song plays in the background with an on/off toggle for control. 🎶
